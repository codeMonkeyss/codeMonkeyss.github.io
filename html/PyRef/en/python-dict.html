<h1>Python Dict</h1>

<p>The dict "dictionary" type is very important because it takes in disorganized data, organizes it,
and it is <b>fast</b>. The dict here is based on the "hash table" data structure.
You will learn how to build and analyze a hash table in CS106B, here we're happy to just use them. Many important algorithms leverage hash tables in some way since they can handle large data sets and remain fast.</p>

'dict' is the name of the Python dict type, so we'll use just 'd' as a generic variable name.

<pre>
d = {}                  # Create empty dict
d['ca'] = 'California'  # 1. Set key/value pairs into dict
d['ok'] = 'Oklahoma'
d['nj'] = 'New Jersey'
d['tx'] = 'Texas'
val = d['nj']           # 2. Retrieve value by key
val = d['xx']           # fails with KeyError
check = 'nj' in d       # 3. in check -> True
</pre>

<p>1. <code>d['ca'] = 'California'</code> - with equal-sign: d[key] = xxx creates a key/value pair in the dict. If a pair was in there already, it is overwritten.</p>

<p>2. <code>val = d['nj']</code> - referring to d[key] retrieves the value for that key, or is a KeyError. Code needs to check that the key is in before doing [ ] retrieval.</p>

<p>3. <code>if 'nj' in d:</code> - use <b>in</b> to check if a key is in the dict or not. This sort of 'in' works for lists too, but for dicts it's much faster.</p>

<p>Key point: dicts (hash tables) are <b>fast</b>. Even if the dict has 1 million key/value pairs in it, performing the get/set/in of single key is very fast. If the dict grows to hold 10 million key/value pairs, the speed is largely unchanged.</p>

<p>Strategy: therefore if we are reading a file or a network taking in disorganized data, load the data into a dict choosing the key and value definitions we want to output. The data will become organized by that key, even though it was in random order as it was read.</p>

<p>The type used as key should be "immutable", often a string or int (or tuple when we get to those).</p>

<h2>Dict Counting</h2>

<p>Here is the canonical logic to load up a dict - in this example
the code counts the number of occurrences of each word, but many useful
dict operations will follow this basic loop/in/out pattern.</p>

<pre>
def strs_counts(strs):
    """
    Given a list of strings, return a 'counts' dict of
    str->count key/value pairs
    """
    counts = {}
    for s in strs:
        # fix up not-in case
        if not s in counts:
            counts[s] = 0
        # invariant: at this line, s is in
        counts[s] += 1
        # alternate 'else' solution:
        #if not s in counts:
        #    counts[s] = 1
        #else:
        #    counts[s] += 1
    return counts
</pre>

<h2>Getting Data out of Dict</h2>

<p>1. <code>len(d)</code> - as you would guess, the number of key/value pairs in the dict</p>

<p>2. <code>d.get(<i>key</i>)</code> - retrieves the value for a key, but if the key is not there, returns None by default (vs. throwing an error like [ ]). A 2 parameter form  <code>d.get(key, missing-value)</code> specifies what value to return if the key is missing. This forms an alternative to writing if/in logic to check if the key is in.</p>

<p>3. <code>d.keys()</code> - returns an iterable of all the keys in dict (in a random order). Can loop over this to get each key. The keys alone, no values.</p>

<p>4. <code>d.values()</code> - returns an iterable of all the values in dict (in a random order). Can loop over this to get each value.</p>

<p>5. <code>d.items()</code> returns an iterable of the key,value pairs. This works with a particular sort of double-variable loop, see below. If you want to look at all of the key,value pairs, this is the most direct way.</p>

<p>The most common pattern for looping over a dict, using sorted() function which returns a linear collection sorted into increasing order:</p>

<pre>
def print_counts2(counts):
    # sort the keys for nicer output
    for key in sorted(counts.keys()):
        print(key, counts[key])
</pre>

The double-variable key,value loop (more detailed explanation in the tuples section below)
<pre>
def print_counts3(counts):
    # key,value loop over .items()
    # unsorted
    for key,value in counts.items():
        print(key, value)
</pre>

<h2>Tuples</h2>

<p>The 'tuple' is a Python type which is like a small list. Tuples are like a list but written within parenthesis, here is a tuple of three strings: <code>('a', 'b', 'c')</code></p>

<p>Accessing a tuple works like a list -- len, [ ], in, slices, loops -- but the big difference is that a tuple is immutable. It is built once and then never changes. There is no append() function.</p>

<pre>
>>><b> t = ('a', 'b', 'c')</b>
>>><b> len(t)</b>
3
>>><b> t[0]</b>
'a'
>>><b> 'c' in t</b>
True
>>><b> t[0:2]</b>
('a', 'b')
>>><b> t[0:2]</b>
('a', 'b')
>>><b> t[0] = 'hi'  </b> # no changing it!
Error:'tuple' object does not support item assignment
</pre>

<p>Tuples are useful where you have a fixed number of things to keep as a group -- e.g. an x,y coordinate pair stored in a len-2 tuple like (4, 10) keeps the x,y together as a unit. In contrast, a list is useful when you have an unlimited number of items you want to store together, such as the typical pattern of reading out of a file and using lst.append() to put all the items together in one list.</p>

<p>Recall that dict-keys should be immutable. Therefore if you have some composite data that you want to use as a dict key, e.g. a string and an int, form them into a tuple ('meh', 16) and then use that as the key.</p>


<h2>Tuples and Assignment</h2>

<p>One quirky but important use of tuples is assignment multiple variable at once, like this:</p>

<pre>
>>><b> (x, y) = (12, 4)</b>
>>><b> x</b>
12
>>><b> y</b>
4
</pre>

<p>The length of the left-hand-side and right-hand-side must be the same (CS terminology protip "lhs" and "rhs".)</p>

<h2>Tuples and Multiple Value Return</h2>

<p>Communicating <b>in</b> to a function is a rich area: you can have any number of parameters, they each get a name. How do you communicate <b>out</b> of a function .. return 1 value. Returning 1 value covers 90% of the cases. But sometimes it really makes sense to return 2 or more values. The Pythonic way to do this is to return a tuple packing together the values. Like this</p>

<pre>
def min2(a, b):
    """
    Given 2 ints, returns (True, min_val) if at least
    one is negative and min_val is the minimum value.
    Otherwise returns (False, None)
    """
    if a<0 or b<0:
        return (True, min(a, b))
    return (False, None)
</pre>

<p>There are 2 requirements:</p>

<p>1. The function doc string must state the size and content-types of the returned tuple. There's no way the caller code can be written correctly without
this information.</p>

<p>2. All paths should return a tuple of that same length, even if it is
(None, None), so that standard looking calling code of the form (x, y) = fn(..) works
without crashing should it hit the None case.</p>

Calling min2 looks like this, catching the len-2 tuple result into 2 variables.
<pre>
    (negative, min_val) = min2(a, b)
    if negative:
       ...
</pre>
-->

<h2>Tuples and Dicts</h2>

<p>One handy use of tuples is the dict.items() function, which returns the entire contents of the dict as an list of len-2 (key, value) tuples.</p>

<pre>
>>><b> d = {'a':1, 'd':4, 'c':2, 'b':3}</b>
>>><b> d</b>
{'a': 1, 'd': 4, 'c': 2, 'b': 3}
>>><b> d.items()</b>
dict_items([('a', 1), ('d', 4), ('c', 2), ('b', 3)])  # (key, value) tuples
>>><b> sorted(d.items())  </b> # same tuples, sorted by key
[('a', 1), ('b', 3), ('c', 2), ('d', 4)]
</pre>

<p>Sorting of tuples goes left-to-right within each tuple -- first sorting by all the [0] values across the tuples, then by [1], and so on.</p>

<p>Once all the data has been loaded into a dict, it's natural to have a process-all-the-data phase. This can be written as a loop over the above d.items() list. The loop syntax below takes one tuple off the list for each iteration, setting the two variable, key and value each time:</p>

<pre>
# Example: for loop setting key/value for each iteration
for key,value in d.items():
    # use key and value in here
</pre>

<p>This is a special version of the for loop, where there are multiple variables, and the number of variables matches the size of a tuples coming off the list. The above example, looping key,value over dict.items() is probably the most common use of this multiple-variable variant of the for loop.</p>
