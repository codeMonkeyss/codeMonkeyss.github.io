<h1>Python Variables and Assignment</h1>

<!--
<p>Issue:
 Show interp trace I guess?</p>
-->

<p>A Python variable represents a little bit of memory, keeping track of a value as the code runs.</p>

<p>A variable is created simply with an "assignment" equal sign <code class="b">=</code> stores a pointer to that value into the variable like this:</p>

<pre>
x = 42
</pre>

<p>
<img src="../img/python-var1.png" alt="alt: variable name x refers to int value 42" />
</p>

<p>Later in the code, appearances of that variable name, e.g.  <code class="b">x</code>, retrieve its current value, in this case 42. <!-- I figure this doesn't really require explanation .. they've seen vars in math so much --></p>

<p>Trying to retrieve the value of a variable that does not exist fails with an error (i.e. no <code>=</code> ever assigned that variable).</p>


<h2>Variable Assignment Rules</h2>

<p>Here is a more complicated code example and a picture of memory for it, with the variables on the left and their values on the right.</p>

<pre>
x = 10
y = 'hello'
y = 'bye'
z = y
</pre>

<p>
<img src="../img/python-var2.png" alt="variable x refers to 10, variable y refers to 'bye', z refers to the same 'bye'" />
</p>

<!--
<p>Assigning a variable sets its arrow to point to the value. Retrieving the value of variable following its arrow.</p>
-->

<p>Things to notice here...</p>

<p>1. Assignment like <code>x = 10</code> above sets a pointer into that variable, pointing to the value.</p>

<p>2. Assignment like <code>y = 'bye'</code> above, where the variable has an existing pointer in it, overwrites the existing pointer with the new one. Put another way, a variable holds just one pointer. Assigning a new pointer gets rid of the old one.</p>

<p>3. Assignment between two variables like <code>z = y</code> above, makes them point to the same thing.
It does not set up a permanent link between the variables; it is simpler than that. This assignment just changes <code>z</code> to point to the <code>y</code> value at that moment.</p>

<!-- (This is described as "shallow" below, rearranging the pointers in the variables.) -->

<p>4. Small observation 1: each value in Python is tagged with its type, so in the example above the number 10 is tagged with the type "int", and the string <code>'hello'</code> is tagged with its type "str".</p>

<p><b>Garbage Collection Aside</b>: in the above example, the string 'hello' exists in memory at one time, but then the variable <code>y</code> is moved to point to something else. When a value such as a 'hello' here is left with no variable pointing to it, it cannot be used any more by the code. Such memory, storing a value that is not used, is called "garbage", and the "garbage collector" facility reclaims that memory, re-using it to hold new values. This is something Python does automatically behind the scenes. Most modern languages have a garbage collection to reclaim memory automatically.</p>

<!-- Just because your programs stores the string 'woot' in memory at one time does not mean 'woot' is there forever. There is a natural re-cycling process yyyyyy
-->

<!-- njp -
<ul class=slide>
<li>could get into types
<li>could have the '+' example here or later .. how much of a hurry are we in?
</ul>

<h2>Variable Swap</h2>

<p>Suppose we have two variables and we want to "swap" their values, so each takes on the value of the other. This is a little coding move that all programmers should know.</p>

<pre>
a = 42
b = 13
</pre>

<p>
<img src="../img/python-varswap1.png" alt="before swap: a is 42, b is 13" />
</p>

<p>It might seem that one can begin with <code>a = <code class="b">, but this does not work, since it overwrites and thus loses the original value of </code>a</code>. The classic 3-line solution uses a temporary variable named "temp" to hold this value during the swap, like this:</p>

<pre>
temp = a
a = b
b = temp
</pre>

<p>Starting with the above diagram, you can trace through the three assignments, leading to this memory structure:</p>

<p>
<img src="../img/python-varswap2.png" alt="after swap: a is 13, b is 42, temp is 42" />
</p>

<h2>Assignment <code>=</code> is Shallow</h2>

<p>The swap example demonstrates a key feature of Python assignment &mdash; each assignment <code>=</code> merely changes what a variable points to. The int, string etc. values are undisturbed. The assignment <code>=</code> in Python just moves an arrow around. In the diagram, this changes the arrows on the left, but the values on the right are undisturbed.</p>

<p>We'll revisit this shallow quality of assignment with parameters and nested data structures.</p>

<h2>Variable Names are Superficial Labels</h2>

<p>Normally variables names are chosen to reflect what data they contain. That said, there
is one funny feature of variable names to know.</p>

<p>Consider the following computation</p>

<pre>
>>><b> x = 6</b>
>>><b> y = x + x</b>
>>><b> y</b>
12
</pre>

<p>Using a couple variables, it computes that doubling 6 makes 12. Suppose instead it was written this way:</p>

<pre>
>>><b> alice = 6</b>
>>><b> bob = alice + alice</b>
>>><b> bob</b>
12
</pre>

<p>This is <b>exactly</b> the same computation, just using different variable names. What matters in a computation is the structure &mdash; which value is used at each spot in the computation. The variable names are just labels on the computation. If we change a variable name consistently throughout the code, the computation will work the same.</p>

<p>That said, though variable names are superficial, good code uses meaningful variable names, reflecting the role of that data in the algorithm.</p>

this is not good enough, cutting for now

<h2>Decomp By Var</h2>

<p>Say we have a <code>points</code> variable which is in the range 0..100. We need to implement a bonus scheme like this: normally the bonus is the points divided by 5. However, if this results in a total over 105, the bonus is reduced to score divided by 10. In all cases, the score is then points plus bonus.</p>

<p>Here's a few lines that implement this algorithm. This code is ok, but we can clean it up with a variable.</p>

<pre>
# have points 0..100

if points + points // 5 > 100:     # over 105 -> smaller bonus
    score = points + points // 10
else:
    score = points + points // 5
</pre>

<p>Here is the same algorithm, but introducing a <code>bonus</code> variable to store that temporary result</p>

<pre>
bonus = score // 5
if score + bonus > 100:     # over 105 -> smaller bonus
    bonus = score // 10
score = score + bonus
</pre>
-->

<!-- cut for now

<p>When the '+' operator gets the 2 values, it can see that the x value is an int.
That's how this works:</p>

<pre>
x = 6
y = x + 10
<h1>y is 16</h1>
</pre>

<p>The above code fails at line 4: '+' doesn't support the first param being a string and the second being an int.
The point here is that as values flow around in python, each value is tagged with its type, and some functions
can use that information (we're not doing it ourselves, but you can observe the system
using type information for us). Surprisingly,
some computer languages do not have this feature! The programmer is supposed to keep track, but here Python
does it for us.</p>
