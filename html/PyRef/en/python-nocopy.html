<h1>Python Not Copying</h1>

<p>Python has a very consistent way of handling memory between lines of code or between functions - there is just one string, or list, or dict, and references to that one proliferate across the lines.</p>

<!-- njp more here -->

<h2>Python Does Not Copy #1 - Lists</h2>

<p>Suppose your code is manipulating a string or list or dict, and so has a reference to this structure. What happens if there is an assignment <code>=</code>? Does this result in two lists?</p>

<pre>
>>><b> lst = [1, 2]</b>
>>><b> lst2 = lst</b>
</pre>

<p>No, there is just the one list. The <code>=</code> works in a "shallow" way, creating an additional reference to the one list.</p>

<p>
<img src="../img/python-nocopy1.png" alt="alt:lst and lst2 point to the same list" />
</p>

<p>Python always works this way - there is just one list or dict or whatever the code created explicitly, e.g. in this case <code>[1, 2]</code>, and then references to that one list are spread around.</p>

<p>We can observe that there's just one list, since changes made on the <code>lst2</code> variable can be seen on the <code>lst</code> variable.</p>

<pre>
>>><b> lst</b>
[1, 2]
>>><b> lst2.append(3)</b>
>>><b> lst2</b>
[1, 2, 3]
>>><b> </b>
>>><b> lst   </b> # shows there was just one list
[1, 2, 3]
</pre>

<h2>Python Does Not Copy #2 - Nesting</h2>

<p>Suppose there is a dictionary <code>d</code>, and a list is stored as a value inside it. What happens when code refers to that list inside the dict? Does that make a copy?</p>

<p>No copy is made. There is the one list inside of the dict, and <code>lst</code> points to that list, even though it is nested inside of something else.</p>

<p>
<img src="../img/python-nocopy2.png" alt="alt:lst points to list inside of dict" />
</p>

<pre>
>>><b> d = {}</b>
>>><b> d['a'] = [1, 2] </b> # put list inside of dict
>>><b> d</b>
{'a': [1, 2]}
>>><b></b>
>>><b> lst = d['a']    </b> # a reference to the list
>>><b> lst</b>
[1, 2]
</pre>

<p>As before, we can observe that there is one list with multiple references by changing it.</p>

<pre>
>>><b> lst = d['a']</b>
>>><b> lst.append(3)</b>
>>><b> lst</b>
[1, 2, 3]
>>><b> </b>
>>><b> d    </b> # Observe the list within d is changed too
{'a': [1, 2, 3]}
</pre>

<h2>Python Does Not Copy #2a - Nesting Again</h2>

<p>Say we have the above case with the list inside the dict at key 'a'. The expression <code>d['a']</code> is a reference to that list. This means the expression <code>d['a']</code> can be used in code to examine or modify that list.</p>

<pre>
>>><b> d = {}</b>
>>><b> d['a'] = [1, 2]</b>
>>><b> d['a']            </b> # look at list
[1, 2]
>>><b> d['a'].append(13) </b> # refer to list and change it
>>><b> d['a'] </b>
[1, 2, 13]
</pre>

<h2>Python Does Not Copy #3 - Parameters and Return</h2>

<p>Suppose we have this code</p>

<pre>
def exclaim(strs):
    """
    Modifies the strs list,
    appending '!' to each str element.
    """
    for i in range(len(strs)):
        strs[i] += '!'

def caller():
    lst = ['a', 'b', 'c']

    exclaim(lst)
    # what's in lst now?
</pre>

<p>What happens when exclaim() is called, passing in the list of strings? Does this make a copy of the list? No, like before, there is never a copy.</p>

<p>
<img src="../img/python-nocopy3.png" alt="alt:caller and called function point to same memory">
</p>

<p>The called function exclaim() just gets a reference to the list that caller created.</p>

<h2>Caller / Called Functions Share Memory = Communicate Changes</h2>

<p>Because the called and caller functions share the one list, that means that changes made by the called function are seen by the caller function - it's just the one data structure being worked on by 2 or more functions.</p>

<p>This is a form of data communication from the called function back to the caller, but it is not so crisp as using <b>return</b>. With return, we see an explicit line with an expression, and that is the value being returned.</p>

<p>In contrast, this "shallow" communication, which is a fine technique, is more broad. The contract of the exclaim() function is that whatever list the caller provides, it is going to be modified.</p>

<!--
<h2>Experiment 1 - Exclaim In The Interpreter</h2>

<p>For the demo, writing this def right in the >>> interpreter, although normally we write defs in PyCharm so we can edit and use them.</p>

<p>Look at this code. What is the english translation of what it does?</p>

<pre>
>>><b> def exclaim(strs):</b>
...   for i in range(len(strs)):
...     strs[i] += '!'
...
>>><b> exclaim</b>
<function exclaim at 0x10cbcba28>
>>><b> </b>
>>><b> </b>
>>><b> lst = ['a', 'b' ,'c']</b>
>>><b> exclaim(lst)</b>
>>><b> </b>
>>><b></b> # what does list look like now?
...
>>><b> lst</b>
['a!', 'b!', 'c!']
</pre>

<p>Conclusion: there is one list or dict, references to that one get passed between functions. Modifications made in one function show up in the others.</p>

<h2>Experiment 2 - What Does = Do Again?</h2>

<p>What does this do <code>for s in lst:</code></p>

<p>Reminder: this creates a variable named <code>s</code> and sets it = to each elem in the list, one at a time, so in the loop we can say <code>s.lower()</code> or whatever to work on each string.</p>

<p>What happens if we instead write the exclaim function with <code>for s in strs:</code> instead of using the index numbers, like this:</p>

<pre>
>>><b> def exclaim(strs):</b>
...   for s in strs:
...     s += '!'
...
>>><b> lst = ['a', 'b' ,'c']</b>
>>><b> exclaim(lst)</b>
>>><b> </b>
>>><b></b> # what does lst look like now?
...
>>><b> lst</b>
['a', 'b', 'c']
</pre>
